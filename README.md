# Credit Card Fraud Detection

## Overview

<p align="justify">This project is focused on developing a robust machine learning model to detect credit card fraud with high accuracy. It encompasses a comprehensive workflow,
  starting from data preprocessing and exploratory data analysis to model training and evaluation. The implementation highlights the use of Random Forest classification,
  showcasing its ability to handle class imbalance and deliver strong predictive performance. 
  Detailed analysis and performance metrics are presented to validate the effectiveness of the model in identifying fraudulent transactions.  </p>

## Dataset

The dataset utilized for this project is sourced from Kaggle : [Credit card Fraud](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mlg-ulb/creditcardfraud/data)

## Workflow

The code will:
1. Load and preprocess the data.
2. Identify and delete duplicate values.
3. Handle missing values and encode variables.
4. Visualize the data.
5. Train the model.
6. Display performance metrics for each model.

## Modeling

**Random Forest Classification** model is evaluated in this project

## Results

* Key Metrics: The final model's accuracy, confusion matrix, and classification report are provided in the code.
